This is xmp2rdf, a utility for parsing XMP metadata and re-serialising it
as somewhat more pleasant RDF.

xmp2rdf uses libxml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/> and Redland <http://librdf.org/>
in order to perform parsing and serialisation. The configure script uses
pkg-config <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config> to locate
both.

If you are reading this file in a git checkout, you will need to build the
configure script before proceeding. The autoreconf(1) utility, part of
autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>, will do this for you:

$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure [OPTIONS]
$ make
$ sudo make install
