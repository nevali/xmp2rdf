This is xmp2rdf, a utility for parsing XMP metadata and re-serialising it
as somewhat more pleasant RDF.

Today, xmp2rdf can only extract the inner RDF from an XMP sidecar. Future
versions may well support reading embedded XMP payloads directly from
images.

xmp2rdf uses libxml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/> and Redland <http://librdf.org/>
in order to perform parsing and serialisation. The configure script uses
pkg-config <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config> to locate
Redland, but you may need to tell it how to find libxml2 -- either by
specifying the installation prefix with --with-libxml2=PREFIX, or by
setting LIBXML2_CPPFLAGS and LIBXML2_LDFLAGS environment variables
before invoking configure. If you installed libxml2 from a package,
you may need to install the separate development package (libxml2-dev
on Debian, libxml2-devel on RedHat), and give the libxml2 prefix
as /usr.

If you are reading this file in a git checkout, you will need to build the
configure script before proceeding. The autoreconf(1) utility, part of
autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>, will do this for you:

$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure [OPTIONS]
$ make
$ sudo make install
