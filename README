This is xmp2rdf, a utility for parsing XMP metadata and re-serialising it
as somewhat more pleasant RDF.

Today, xmp2rdf can only extract the inner RDF from an XMP sidecar. Future
versions may well support reading embedded XMP payloads directly from
images.

xmp2rdf uses libxml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/> and Redland <http://librdf.org/>
in order to perform parsing and serialisation. The configure script uses
pkg-config <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config> to locate
both.

If you are reading this file in a git checkout, you will need to build the
configure script before proceeding. The autoreconf(1) utility, part of
autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>, will do this for you:

$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure [OPTIONS]
$ make
$ sudo make install
